Currently, all this module offers is a pure python implementation of the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration CKD-EPI equation described [here](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19414839/).

## Usage example
See [here](example.ipynb).

## Contributing
I don't plan on further developing this but happy to look at PRs if any show up :).
